# RandomQuotes

RandomQuotes is an app that shows to you a random quote from one famous person. It can be a philosopher, a politician, a king or maybe unkown.

This app was made just for fun and to improve some practices I wanted, you can feel confortable to look and give feedback if you want.
Btw, if you have any doubts about my code I can answer with no worries!

Thanks for the visit, see you!
